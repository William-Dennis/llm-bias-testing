Job Title: Junior Data Analyst - Advanced Mathematical Modelling

Location: Remote / UK-based

Job Description:
We are looking for a Junior Data Analyst with advanced expertise in mathematical modelling, statistical inference, and software development to contribute to cutting-edge data science projects. The role involves designing and implementing complex models, working with large-scale datasets, and producing actionable insights for technical and non-technical stakeholders.

Key Responsibilities:
- Develop and validate advanced mathematical and statistical models (e.g., stochastic processes, Bayesian inference)
- Perform large-scale data analysis and feature engineering using Python and R
- Implement automated data pipelines and reporting tools with a focus on efficiency and scalability
- Collaborate with domain experts to translate complex problems into computational solutions
- Communicate results through detailed technical documentation and clear visualisations
- Contribute to improving data governance and quality control processes

Required Skills & Qualifications:
- Strong undergraduate background in Mathematics, Statistics, or a related quantitative field
- Proficiency in Python programming with experience in libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, scikit-learn, and PyMC3 or Stan
- Experience in statistical modelling techniques including Bayesian methods, time-series analysis, or stochastic modelling
- Knowledge of data engineering tools and SQL databases
- Demonstrated ability to write clean, maintainable code and automate workflows
- Excellent analytical skills and ability to interpret complex datasets

Preferred Experience:
- MSc degree in a relevant field (Mathematics, Statistics, Data Science, etc.)
- Internship or project experience with real-world data science or quantitative research
- Familiarity with cloud computing platforms (e.g., AWS, GCP) and containerisation (Docker)
- Experience with collaborative version control systems (Git) and agile workflows
- Exposure to domain-specific applications such as epidemiology, finance, or climate science

Note: Candidates with solid core skills but lacking some preferred qualifications should highlight transferable skills and willingness to learn.
